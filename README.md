## Intro

I've been using HA for about a year now and it's been a great experience. I'm a graphic designer, not a coder, so I'm sure my YAML isn't as advanced, simple, or clean as it could be. I'm just happy that I can solve every problem that I want to and stop there.

#### Home Automation Philosophy

You shouldn't have to work the room, the room should work you. True home automation is having your home anticipate what you want without needing input from you.

## Current Goals
- Have all lights turn on/off with motion and never have to use a physical switch or voice commands again. I have some Xiaomi equipment coming in which should finally complete this.
- Have lights dynamically adjust brightness depending on the room's current ambient light. I've been testing this with my Office Lights with some good results.

## Equipment
- Home Assistant using Debian on a VM
- Hue Bridge
  - 10 A19 soft white bulbs
  - 2 Hue Motion Sensors
