## Intro

I've been using HA for about a year now and it's been a great experience. I'm a graphic designer, not a coder, so I'm sure my YAML isn't as advanced, simple, or clean as it could be. I'm just happy that I can solve every problem that I want to so far.

#### Home Automation Philosophy

You shouldn't have to work the room, the room should work you. True home automation is having your home anticipate what you want without needing any input from you.

Using voice commands are nice and all, but that ends up being just another switch you have to use and is ultimately just a remote control, not automation.

## Current Goals
- (DONE) Have all lights turn on/off with motion and never have to use a physical switch or voice commands again. I have some Xiaomi equipment coming in which should finally complete this.
- Have lights dynamically adjust brightness depending on the room's current ambient light. I've been testing this with my Office Lights with some good results.
