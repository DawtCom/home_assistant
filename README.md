## Home Automation Philosophy

You shouldn't have to work the room, the room should work you. True home automation is having your home anticipate what you want without needing any input from you.

Using voice commands are nice and all, but that ends up being just another switch you have to use and is ultimately just a remote control, not automation.

## Notable Automations [(Wiki)](https://github.com/seangreen2/home_assistant/wiki)
### [Room Presence with Google Homes](https://github.com/seangreen2/home_assistant/wiki/Room-Presence-with-Google-Homes) DEPRECATED
The Google Home integration will soon be removed from Home Assistant and as such I will be removing the tutorial from my wiki. In its place I have created a Room Presence Logic automation which I will write up when I get the time.

### [Cool or Heat your Home Before you Arrive](https://github.com/seangreen2/home_assistant/wiki/Beat-the-Heat-and-Begin-Cooling-your-Home-before-you-Arrive)
It's never fun to come home to a hot and humid home just to have your AC kick on as soon as it detects you on your WiFi, or however else you have your local presence set up. Like you, I used to also come home and be miserable until the HVAC finally caught up to my comfortable temperatures. Depending on your preferences this could take TENS OF MINUTES! That simply will not do. This automation uses the Proximity Sensor to intelligently detect if you're on your way home and will begin making it comfortable before you arrive.

### [Automatic Brightness for Lighting](https://github.com/seangreen2/home_assistant/wiki/Automatic-Brightness-for-Lighting)
Due to renting and lack of any overhead lighting, we use Hue smart bulbs in standing lamps. We don’t have any of the expensive color bulbs, but I still wanted our normal white bulbs to slowly dim during the evening to encourage sleepiness. I developed two automations to take care of this problem and wanted to avoid using any custom components in the process. One automation for turning on the lights to the desired brightness, the other automation being a transitional one where it tracks the Sun and only dims the lights if they are already on.

The automations are highly customizable with each room having different light values attached to them. My only requirement for this was to avoid having the lights initially turn on to 100% brightness and then dim to the appropriate setting. Fortunately, these automations avoid that problem and turn on to the appropriate brightness depending on the Sun’s location. Another bonus of tracking the Sun for brightness is that these automations double for the morning and don’t blind you as you are still waking up.

### [Sleep Detection with Tasker](https://github.com/seangreen2/home_assistant/wiki/Turning-off-your-lights-with-Tasker)
Using a fantastic Android app called [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&hl=en_US), whenever we plug in our phones to charge at night, a script is triggered to turn off all the lights and disable the automation that turns on the bedroom motion sensor. When unplugging our phones in the morning, another script is triggered to turn the automations back on. Before Tasker we used to use voice commands to accomplish this, but this is far more elegant and was surprisingly simple to accomplish.
